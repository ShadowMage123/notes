To Rosie

im sorry about calling you names at Gran's. That is what lead me to write this letter.
what I appreciate about you;
you are: funny, musical, intelligent, fun, caring,  understanding, loving,thoughtful, truthful, trustworthy, good at voices (but use them a little too much).  And you try to calm down when you are angry.
But best of all: you're Rosie !!!!!
